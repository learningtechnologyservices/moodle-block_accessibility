Accessibility Block for Moodle

PLEASE NOTE: This plugin is no longer being actively maintained by Brickfield. The main challenge is with the
third-party external ATBar, which is not being maintained at all by its authors, at some point has lost all
of its docs, and doesn't have an up-to-date SSL.

If someone has funding, and would like to cover the updating of this plugin, we would be happy to engage with you
on this.

We are planning on sharing a new plugin which will provide guidance to users with their font size, font colour,
and other display options, depending on their browser. We will update this readme once it's available.

Provides options for changing text size and colour scheme. Settings can be saved to persist between sessions. Colour settings can
be defined at the block instance level (Block instance configuration).

Also integrates ATbar from Southampton University ECS http://www.atbar.org. Code used under BSD Licence.

To install, place all files in /blocks/accessibility/ directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. To achieve block
appearance throughout entire Moodle site (so-called "Sticky block") once the plugin is installed into Moodle,
it's recommended to add its instance onto the Moodle homepage (/index.php). Homepage instance of the block enables "Page contexts"
option in block instance configuration to be set to "Display throughout entire site".
