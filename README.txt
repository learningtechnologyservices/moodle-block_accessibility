Accessibility Block for Moodle

NO LONGER USABLE! You have been warned. Not usable on any supported Moodle versions. Not maintainable due to dependancies on out-of-date third party libraries, such as the AT Bar.

Most of the features in this plugin are now standard browser options instead, and we would recommend and prioritise educating learners on how to use the many accessibility features of their browsers, thus making all their websites more barrier-free!

Legacy Information: NO LONGER USABLE!

Provides options for changing text size and colour scheme. Settings can be saved to persist between sessions. Colour settings can
be defined at the block instance level (Block instance configuration).

Also integrates ATbar from Southampton University ECS http://www.atbar.org. Code used under BSD Licence.

To install, place all files in /blocks/accessibility/ directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. To achieve block
appearance throughout entire Moodle site (so-called "Sticky block") once the plugin is installed into Moodle,
it's recommended to add its instance onto the Moodle homepage (/index.php). Homepage instance of the block enables "Page contexts"
option in block instance configuration to be set to "Display throughout entire site".
